## The Alone OS project
Alone OS is a scratch OS made by me
# How to Run Alone OS?
you can run alone OS both 
- from the Scratch Project
- Or
- Downloading it and running it on Scratch/Turbowarp (you'll get better performance on turbowarp and also being able to use 16:9 but Only the wallpapers support the 16:9 Aspect Ratio)
# this is the project's link https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/991868441/ [Try Alone OS if you want to]
its main inspiration is from Linux,which is pretty noticable
i decided to make it opensource on github so that people can 
- use my code and sprites (but by crediting me) in their projects
- modify or improve my code
- Finding Bugs
- Learning From my code
# Ideology
Alone OS's ideology is "that its easy enought to be modified but complex enought to be an actual working Operating System on scratch"
# Making APPS
you can make apps based on the "window App" or even the stock apps,
go in "Store/User Made Apps" and read the README.md to see the rules
# Repo structure
- Apps:where the stock Alone OS apps go
- Base-For-Apps:the base for apps "the window app" is in this folder with its window too,you can modify it and make your own app
- Desktop:here go the desktop environments of Alone OS
- F.SH Ports:here go the required ports for the F.SH app in the store
- Log in Screen:Here there are the components for the log in screen
- REQUIRED TO EVEN START:Here go the Fundamental Starter components of Alone OS,if you want to make your own Alone OS distro please put the components here as the first things in your project
- Store:Here go the apps in the store, there are apps made by me and most likely user made apps too
- Extras:Here there are extra things that arent fully required
- Installer:Here there are the components of the installer app of Alone OS,you can use it in your scratch OS if you cant make one
# Using my code or scratch sprites
You can use my code and scratch sprites (that's the literal reason why its here on github) but you have to credit me if you do
# Making a distro
if you want to make an Alone OS distro you have to 
- mention that its an Alone OS distro/Alone OS based Operating system
- include which release its based on and if you update the distro to match with the latest release of Alone OS include it
# KOnsole
KOnsole is the "terminal" of Alone OS,when you make your own distro,remember to update the branding in the terminal in places like "screenfetch"
# Warning! : KOnsole is PC only for now,its yet not compatible with mobile systems without a physical keyboard
# Current Release = 9.2 Tiramisu
