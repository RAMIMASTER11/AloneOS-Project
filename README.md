# The Alone OS project
# Alone OS is a scratch OS made by me
# https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/991868441/
# it takes inspiration more of from linux
# i decided to make it opensource on github so that people can actually use my code and sprites (but by crediting me) on their projects
# Alone OS's ideology is that its easy enought to be modified but complex enought to be an actual working Operating System on scratch
